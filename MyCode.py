# Example. temp = '' list[i] = 2, list[pos] = 3
#        temp = list[i]  # temp will take the value of 'list[i]' which is 2
#        list[i] = list[pos]  # 'list[i]' will take the value of 'list[pos]' which is 3
#        list[pos] = temp  # Last 'list[pos]' will take the value of 'temp' which 2
# Final value of the variables
# list[i] = 3
# list[pos] = 2
# THIS IS ALSO CALLED SWAPPING METHOD
#        list[i], list[pos] = list[pos], list[i]  # This method can also be used in 'swapping methods'/'sorting method'
#    print(list)  # prints the result of the sorted list

# list = [5,1,2,6,8,9]  # unsorted predetermined list
# search(list)  # This will call out the 'search' function for list

# print(list)  # prints the present list
